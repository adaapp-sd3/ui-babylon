# Babylon Healthcheck UI example code

This repo contains example code for the chatbot we implement as part of the UI module.

You should work on the master branch. At any point you can check out the finished branches to see how it should look at the end of each workshop.

## Initial HTML Tutorial

1. Create a new folder on your computer, and open the folder in your text editor
2. Create a new file called index.html and open it 
3. Type html and then press tab to choose the html:5 prediction. This should result in the following output:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="ie=edge">
  <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
  
</body>
</html>
```

4. Add a main element, and inside it two section elements. Give the section elements IDs of "welcome" and "chatbot". 
5. To start to make our page accessible, add a "skip to content" link outside the main element. Link it to the chatbot section e.g. `<a href="#chatbot" title="Skip to content">Skip to content</a>`
