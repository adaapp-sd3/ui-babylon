## vanilla js example

This branch is to demo what the vanilla javascript might be to produce the same results as the ReactJS version. This is to show that vanilla javascript is a vaild way to go on a project if you know what you're doing and the project isn't going to get too big. 

WARNING: as a project scope gets bigger, the code usually gets more complex and will require some sort of strucutre that can easily communicated to your team or others if Open Sourcing. USing a framework is a good choice if you know that a project will get large or require lots of people to work on it at the same time.
